Hi!

I'm Goutham Harsha. You can call me _xek_. Welcome to my little corner in the world wide web.


I am a Software Engineer - II at [Microsoft](https://azure.microsoft.com) in
the Azure team. 

I am passionate about computer science and the problem of _scale_ fascinates me. This website is an attempt to create a system for constantly learning and becoming a better engineer by documenting my progress and thoughts about software development, programming and other things that interest me.

Before working at Microsoft, I worked at 
[Oracle (Server Technologies)](http://www.oracle.com/index.html) on 
 Oracle Database 12c and [Kiwi Inc.](http://www.kiwiup.com/games/), a Sequoia Capital funded game development start up .

I hold a Bachelor's degree in engineering (Computer Science) from [(BITS), Pilani](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in) - one of India's premier most engineering institutions.
