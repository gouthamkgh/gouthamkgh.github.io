## Hello!

I'm Goutham Harsha, and I am a Software Engineer at Microsoft. I work on highly available, fault-tolerant and distributed systems at cloud scale as a part of the [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) team.

## My Background

I am passionate about computer science and the problem of scale fascinates me. I love solving challenging problems and I'm hoping to make my own (small) dent in the world some day. 

This website is an attempt to create a system for constantly learning and becoming a better engineer by documenting my progress and thoughts about software development, programming and other things that interest me.

Before working at Microsoft, I worked at [Kiwi Inc.](http://www.kiwiup.com/games/), a Sequoia Capital funded game development start up with over 50 million downloads in the Play Store and [Oracle (Server Technologies)](http://www.oracle.com/index.html) on Oracle Database 12c.

I hold a Bachelor's degree in engineering (Computer Science) from [BITS, Pilani](http://www.bits-pilani.ac.in) - one of India's premier most engineering institutions.
